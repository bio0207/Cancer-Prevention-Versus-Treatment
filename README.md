This repository contains the code, datasets, and analysis for the project titled "Prevention vs Treatment to Address Cancer Inequalities: A Comparative Analysis of Local Authorities in Lancashire".

The project explores the relationship between deprivation and cancer outcomes (lung, breast, and bowel) alongside the potential effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies across Lancashire. The code and datasets are organised into separate folders for each cancer type, lung, breast, and bowel.
